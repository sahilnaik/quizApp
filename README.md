A simple quiz app using React for front-end and firebase as backend.
Found random quizzes on the internet and used Firebases' Realtime database and imported the included quiz.json file.
This is a full-stack web application as it leverages realtime database to fetch data and is presented to the user using React.js.
Firebase uses a No-SQL database approach which makes it easier to manipulate and add data to the existing database which is why I used it as a backend for this application.
React makes it easier to make a Single Page Application which makes the web app faster and efficient.
Randomisation of quizzes and options, dashboard and incorrect/correct questions on results page would be something I would work on if I were to spend additional time on this application.
Hosted the application on firebase. Link to the web app:
